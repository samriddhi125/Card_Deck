# Card_Deck
This Java program implements a simple card deck with functionality to create, shuffle, print, and perform various operations on the deck of cards. The program consists of two main classes, `Card` and `Deck`, and a `Main` class to interact with the user through a console menu.

## Card Class

The `Card` class represents an individual playing card with attributes for suit and value. It includes getter and setter methods for suit and value, as well as a `toString` method for easy printing.

## Deck Class

The `Deck` class manages a collection of `Card` objects, allowing users to create a standard deck, shuffle it, print the entire deck or a random card, deal 5 random cards, check if two cards are from the same suit, check if two cards have the same value, find the position of a specific card, and shuffle the deck.

## Main Class

The `Main` class serves as the entry point for the program, providing a simple console menu for users to interact with the card deck functionalities. Users can choose from options like creating a deck, printing the deck, printing a random card, checking if two cards have the same suit or value, finding a specific card, dealing 5 random cards, and shuffling the deck.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac Main.java Card.java Deck.java`.
3. Run the program with `java Main`.

## Usage

You can create a deck, print it, print a random card, check for same suit or value, find a specific card, deal 5 random cards, and shuffle the deck.
